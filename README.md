# Botium Toys Security Audit  

This repository contains my professional case study for a **Security Audit** conducted on Botium Toys, a fictional company used in the Google Cybersecurity Fundamentals course.  

I approached this project as if I were a security consultant hired by Botium Toys to review their security posture, identify gaps, and recommend improvements.  

## Objectives  
- Assess Botium Toys’ existing security policies and controls.  
- Identify vulnerabilities that could impact business continuity.  
- Provide practical, risk-based recommendations.  

## Deliverables  
- [Security Audit Report](SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md) – full findings and recommendations  
- Evidence folder – supporting screenshots and documentation  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Security audit methodology (mapped to NIST CSF)  
- Risk analysis and mitigation planning  
- Professional report writing and documentation  
- GitHub for version-controlled documentation
